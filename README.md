# Q-Learning Implementation for Lunar Lander

This repository contains an implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm, applied to the Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI's Gym. The purpose of this project is to explore and learn the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, specifically Q-Learning, through a hands-on approach.

## Project Overview

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Q-Learning is a model-free RL algorithm that aims to learn the value of state-action pairs, represented as a Q-table. This project focuses on implementing Q-Learning to solve the Lunar Lander problem.

The Lunar Lander environment simulates a space vehicle landing on the moon. The agent's task is to control the lander's engine to achieve a soft landing on the landing pad. The agent receives rewards based on its actions and the resulting states.

## Features

- **Q-Learning Algorithm**: A simple implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm.
- **Lunar Lander Environment**: Utilizes the OpenAI Gym's Lunar Lander environment.
- **Exploration Strategies**: Implements epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration-exploitation balance.
- **Training and Evaluation**: The agent is trained over multiple episodes, and its performance is evaluated based on the cumulative rewards.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

pip install numpy matplotlib gym

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lunar-lander-qlearning.git
   cd lunar-lander-qlearning

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Open the `Reniforcement_Learning(Lunar_Landing).ipynb` notebook and run the cells to train the Q-Learning agent on the Lunar Lander environment.

## Learning Objectives

This project is designed for those who are new to reinforcement learning and want to understand the basics of Q-Learning. By working through the code, you'll learn:

- How to define and initialize a Q-table.
- How to implement the Q-Learning algorithm.
- How to balance exploration and exploitation using the epsilon-greedy strategy.
- How to evaluate the performance of a trained agent in a simulated environment.

## Results

After training, the agent should be able to achieve a stable landing on the moon's surface, maximizing the rewards. The notebook includes visualizations of the training process, such as the cumulative rewards over episodes, to help you understand the learning progression.
