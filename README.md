# Q-Learning-Implementation-for-Lunar-Lander
This repository contains an implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm, applied to the Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI's Gym. The purpose of this project is to explore and learn the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, specifically Q-Learning, through a hands-on approach.
